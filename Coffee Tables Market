<h2>Coffee Tables Market REGIONAL INSIGHTS</h2>
<h3>North America</h3>
<p>United States: The U.S. economy has shown resilience post-pandemic but faces inflationary pressures, particularly in housing and consumer goods. The Federal Reserve's interest rate policies remain a focus, as the balance between controlling inflation and avoiding recession has impacted spending, borrowing, and business growth. Key sectors like tech, finance, and renewable energy are experiencing dynamic changes, with AI, fintech, and green technology receiving heavy investments.</p>
<p>Canada: Economic stability remains a hallmark of Canada&rsquo;s economy, although housing affordability and household debt are pressing issues. Canada continues to emphasize a green energy transition, investing in hydroelectric, wind, and solar power. The nation is also focused on attracting skilled labor, especially in technology, healthcare, and energy, as part of its economic strategy.</p>
<p>Mexico: Mexico has benefited from a nearshoring trend, as companies look to relocate manufacturing closer to the U.S. market. With a strong trade relationship via USMCA (the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement), Mexico is seeing investments in its automotive, aerospace, and electronics industries. However, inflation, interest rates, and a need for infrastructure development remain areas of focus.</p>
